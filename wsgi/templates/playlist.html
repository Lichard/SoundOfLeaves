<h3>Divine Comedy<h3>
<br />
<h4>Dante Alighieri</h4>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His glory, by whose might all things are mov'd,
Pierces the universe, and in one part
Sheds more resplendence, elsewhere less.  In heav'n,
That largeliest of his light partakes, was I,
Witness of things, which to relate again
Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence;
For that, so near approaching its desire
Our intellect is to such depth absorb'd,
That memory cannot follow.  Nathless all,
That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm
Could store, shall now be matter of my song. 
<br /><br />
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Benign Apollo! this last labour aid,
And make me such a vessel of thy worth,
As thy own laurel claims of me</p>

Algernon.  Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?</p>
